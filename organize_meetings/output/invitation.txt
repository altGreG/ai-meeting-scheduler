Subject: Invitation to Enjoy a Beer Together!  

Dear Michael,  

I hope this email finds you well! My name is Mariusz Pudzianowski, and I would be thrilled to invite you to join me for a beer sometime soon. It would be a great opportunity to relax, chat, and enjoy some quality time together.  

Could you please let me know your availability? Specifically, I would love to know what date, time, and place would work best for you. I'm flexible and open to suggestions!  

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best regards,  
Mariusz Pudzianowski
